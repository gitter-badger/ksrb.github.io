Yes this page is a massive WIP but [Gradle](https://github.com/ksrb/Gradle-SS) is so shiny right now
and [JavaScript](https://github.com/ksrb/JSSS) is so awesome that well a GitHub page can wait (or I need to get my priorities straight).

###TODOs
* Convert Resume to HTML
* Convert Graphic Design portfolio to HTML
* Improve interactivity with Angular
* Get [Karma](http://karma-runner.github.io/0.12/index.html) in there
* Find a excuse to use Gradle
